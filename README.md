# opioid_logisticregressionmodel

# Description:
The goal of this project was to build a logistic regression model in R to predict opioid usage based on demographic, personality, and drug usage data. 

All data was taken from this site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29

# Building the Model: 
Stepwise selection was used for the building of the model, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets to  evaluate its success. 

# Visualizing the Model:
opioidmodel_finalcode.R contains code to visualize the model in several ways (with histograms, calibration-in-the-large plots, density plots, ROC curves).
